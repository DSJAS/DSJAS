# DSJAS Usage Disclaimer

DSJAS does include some functionality which could be used maliciously. After all, we are quite literally mimicking a bank site. This, in the wrong hands, could be misused. I realise that it would be slightly irresponsible to put this software out in the world without some kind of guidelines/usage disclaimer. So, behold, the DSJAS usage disclaimer!

Although I stand by the promise of free usage given by the MIT licence, I would like to put forward some information on what I consider to be appropriate and responsible usage.

As mentioned earlier, some of DSJAS's features could be abused and used in ways which I didn't intend them. So, I'm putting this out there now: **DSJAS is not scam software; it is designed to be used to waste the time of scammers to make the internet a better place by making scamming less financially effective!**

If you are using this software to steal people's money or scam people out of the banking details, I can't really stop you without compromising the security and privacy of legitimate users (not to mention the integrity of the software). I'm not going to go around trying to sue people because they used my software in a way I don't like or agree with.

In the same way that you *could* use Metasploit to hack somebody's computer, you *could* use DSJAS to run a scam. But, **you** are responsible for your own actions.

All I can say is, please, only use this software for what it is intended to do: bait scammers and make their illegal operations slightly less financially promising.
