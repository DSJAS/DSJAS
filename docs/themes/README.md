# DSJAS Themes - *Developer documentation*

> **Looking for help with using themes?** This guide is aimed at developers in the process of making a theme. If you're looking for help with installing, configuring or using a theme, please refer to the *administration* documentation

Welcome to DSJAS theme development! DSJAS themes are the most important thing the site uses and the core feature that sets DSJAS apart from every other fake banking program. Themes are so important to DSJAS that the site can't even function without at least one theme being installed and enabled!

So, when you sign up to making a theme, you are getting a huge amount of control and creative freedom - creating *the most important* extension method of the site.

I'm going to keep this readme quite minimal. Before you start creating a theme, please read the disclaimer in the documentation and take a look at the built-in themes to see how they work.

**Happy theming!**
